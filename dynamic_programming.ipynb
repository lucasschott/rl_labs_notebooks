In order to estimate how good a state is, either a state value function $V(x)$ or a state-action value function $Q(x,u)$ is used. $V^{\\pi}(x)$ is the expected return when starting from state $x$ then following policy $\\pi$ and it is processed based on the Bellman Expectation Equation for deterministic policies:\n",
